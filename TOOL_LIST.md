## Usage Notes

### Legacy Tool Support
ZMCPTools maintains backward compatibility by keeping legacy browser tools available while recommending modern alternatives. Legacy tools are clearly marked with `[LEGACY]` in their descriptions.

### Foundation Session Optimization
Many orchestration tools support `foundation_session_id` parameters for 85-90% cost reduction through shared context management.

### Type Safety
All tools are built with TypeScript and Zod schemas for runtime validation, ensuring reliable operation and clear error messages.

### MCP Compliance
Every tool follows MCP 1.15.0 protocol standards with proper JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation, error handling, and schema validation.
