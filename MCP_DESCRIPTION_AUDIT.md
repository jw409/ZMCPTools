# MCP Description Quality Audit

## Summary

Audited all MCP tools, resources, and prompts for description quality.

### Results

✅ **Resources (20)**: Excellent quality
- All have emoji-prefixed use cases
- Include examples and query parameters
- Clear "when to use" guidance

⚠️ **Tools (37)**: Needs improvement
- Most lack "when to use" guidance
- Missing emoji prefixes for quick scanning
- No concrete examples in descriptions

✅ **Prompts (0)**: N/A (intentionally removed)

## Resource Description Quality ✅

**Good examples:**

```
🔍 SEARCH BEFORE IMPLEMENTING: Search GitHub issues, architecture docs,
implementation patterns, and prior solutions. Contains: ZMCPTools issues,
TalentOS architecture (CLAUDE.md, etc/*.md, docs/*.md), design decisions,
and known solutions. Use for: finding prior work, understanding architecture,
discovering existing solutions, checking if feature exists. GPU-accelerated
semantic + BM25 hybrid search. Example: knowledge://search?query=resource+migration+MCP&limit=5
```

```
👥 LIST ALL AGENTS: View spawned agents with filtering by status
(active/completed/failed/terminated) and type (backend/frontend/testing/documentation).
Use for: checking what agents are running, finding agents by task type, monitoring
agent health, debugging agent issues. Supports pagination for large agent pools.
Example: agents://list?status=active&type=backend&limit=20
```

**Pattern:**
1. Emoji prefix (quick visual scanning)
2. Primary use case (capitalized, attention-grabbing)
3. What it contains/does
4. "Use for:" list (concrete scenarios)
5. Example URI with query params

## Tool Description Quality ⚠️

**Current (basic technical summary):**

```
name: 'create_browser_session'
description: 'Create a new browser session with intelligent auto-close and session management'
```

**Recommended (with use case guidance):**

```
name: 'create_browser_session'
description: '🌐 START BROWSER AUTOMATION: Create isolated browser session for web scraping,
testing, or automation. Auto-closes after inactivity. Use for: navigating sites, filling forms,
taking screenshots. Creates chromium/firefox/webkit instance with stealth features.'
```

## Improvement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Browser Tools (13 tools)
Add emoji prefixes and use cases:
- `create_browser_session` → 🌐 START BROWSER AUTOMATION
- `navigate_and_scrape` → 🔍 ONE-SHOT WEB SCRAPING
- `interact_with_page` → 🖱️ INTERACT WITH ELEMENTS
- `perform_dynamic_interaction` → 🎯 GOAL-ORIENTED AUTOMATION
- `manage_browser_sessions` → 📊 SESSION MANAGEMENT

### Priority 2: Knowledge Graph Tools (13 tools)
Add when-to-use guidance:
- `store_knowledge_memory` → 💾 CAPTURE INSIGHTS (store learnings, decisions, patterns)
- `search_knowledge_graph_gpu` → ⚡ FAST SEMANTIC SEARCH (10x faster, requires GPU)
- `prune_knowledge_memory` → 🧹 CLEANUP LOW-QUALITY (remove duplicates, conflicts)

### Priority 3: Other Tools (11 tools)
- Browser AI DOM (5 tools)
- Tree Summary (5 tools)
- Progress Reporting (1 tool)

## Token Impact Analysis

Current registration payload:
```
Tools: 37 × 120 tokens = 4,440 tokens
Resources: 20 × 30 tokens = 600 tokens
Prompts: 0 × 50 tokens = 0 tokens
──────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: ~5,040 tokens
```

Improving tool descriptions won't increase token cost significantly
(descriptions are already part of the 120 token budget), but will
dramatically improve LLM's ability to choose the right tool.

## Next Actions

1. ✅ Update TOOL_LIST.md (completed)
2. ✅ Document MCP registration format (completed)
3. ⏳ Consider tool description improvements (future PR)
4. ⏳ Verify no deprecated tools in registration (verify with /mcp restart)

## Architectural Insight

**Resources win** because:
- Forced to use URI templates (encourages good design)
- Smaller token budget (30 vs 120) → forces clarity
- Natural fit for read operations → easier to describe

**Tools struggle** because:
- Broader scope (mutations, workflows, complex operations)
- Larger token budget → encourages verbosity
- Harder to distill "when to use" into brief description
