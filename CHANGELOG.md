and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 🔄 **Enhanced Agent Lifecycle Management** - Intelligent activity-based monitoring system
  - Tool usage serves as natural heartbeat (no artificial timers)
  - Process PID tracking and `/proc/{pid}` validation for zombie detection
  - Fuzzy timeout system (20-30 minutes with random jitter) prevents thundering herd
  - Automatic cleanup of dead processes (`terminated_zombie`) and stuck agents (`terminated_timeout`)
  - Integration with existing claude-observability hooks for seamless operation

### Enhanced
- 📊 **Database Schema** - Added lifecycle tracking columns to `agent_sessions`
  - `last_activity_at` - tracks when agent last used a tool
  - `process_pid` - stores actual process ID for validation
  - `timeout_seconds` - configurable per-agent timeout settings
- 🧹 **Agent Cleanup System** - Enhanced existing cleanup with PID-based detection
  - Smart zombie detection using process validation
  - Activity-based timeout detection with configurable thresholds
  - Comprehensive test suite for lifecycle management validation

## [0.2.2] - 2025-01-14

### Added
- 🔗 **Claude Hooks Integration** - Automatic session start context injection
  - Reminds Claude about available MCP tools and knowledge graph capabilities
  - Session-scoped injection prevents context bloat
  - Non-destructive settings.json merging
- 🎯 **Smart Context Awareness** - Automatic awareness of core tools including:
  - `analyze_project_structure()` for codebase understanding
  - `search_knowledge_graph()` for cross-session learning
  - Plan creation tools for task orchestration

### Fixed
- Fixed ESM module `__dirname` compatibility issue in installer
- Hooks now copy correctly from dist during installation

### Changed
- **Global Rebranding** - All references updated from "ClaudeMcpTools" to "ZMCPTools"
- **Command Updates** - CLI commands now use `zmcp-tools` consistently
- **Enhanced Installation** - Installer now configures:
  - `.claude/hooks/` directory with context injection
  - `.claude/settings.json` with hook configuration
  - Automatic MCP tools awareness on session start

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-14

### Added
- Initial Claude Hooks foundation

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- 🎯 **Streamlined Plan System** - Consolidated planning tools from 10+ to 4 essential tools:
  - `create_execution_plan` - Create high-level execution plans from objectives  
  - `get_execution_plan` - Retrieve plans with progress tracking via linked Tasks
  - `execute_with_plan` - Execute plans by creating coordinated Tasks for agents
  - `list_execution_plans` - List and monitor execution plans
- 📋 **Enhanced Task-Plan Integration** - Plans now create Tasks for implementation, providing clear separation between high-level orchestration (Plans) and specific work items (Tasks)
- 🧹 **Tool Consolidation** - Reduced tool bloat by streamlining plan management while maintaining full functionality

### Changed
- **Plan System Architecture** - Plans are now high-level orchestration templates that generate Tasks for execution
- **Progress Tracking** - Plan progress is now derived from linked Task completion status
- **Tool Naming** - Clarified distinction between Plans (orchestration templates) and Tasks (work items)

### Technical Details
- Simplified plan execution flow: Plan → Task creation → Agent assignment
- Improved separation of concerns between orchestration and task management
- Enhanced progress tracking through Task-Plan relationships

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-02

### Added
- 🚀 **Complete multi-agent orchestration system** with 65+ enhanced MCP tools
- 🎯 **Architect-led coordination** for intelligent task breakdown and agent spawning
- 🎨 **Modern CLI interface** built with Typer + Rich for beautiful terminal experience
- 🎛️ **Web dashboard** with real-time monitoring and agent management
- 📂 **Enhanced file operations** with smart ignore patterns and fuzzy string replacement
- 🌳 **Project analysis tools** with AI-optimized structure analysis and dead code detection
- 📚 **Documentation intelligence** with automated scraping and semantic search
- 🤖 **Multi-agent spawning** with dependencies, real-time communication, and shared memory
- 🔧 **One-command installation** via `uv tool install claude-mcp-tools`
- 📝 **Automatic CLAUDE.md integration** with architect guidance and examples

### Fixed
- 🔍 **Claude Code MCP tool discovery** - Now correctly shows all 59 orchestration tools instead of 37
- 🚀 **Installer launcher script generation** - Fixed to use proper `exec` format instead of `uv run python -m`
- 💾 **UV tool caching issue** - Resolved problem where CLI updates weren't reflected due to bytecode caching
- 🏷️ **FastMCP compatibility** - Added explicit tool names for Claude Code tool name validation
- 🧹 **Installer cleanup** - Removed redundant installer directory and consolidated installation logic

### Technical Details
- **Python Support**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Dependencies**: FastMCP 2.9.0+, FastAPI, ChromaDB, Playwright, SQLAlchemy
- **Storage**: Local data at `~/.claude/zmcptools/` with intelligent caching
- **Installation**: Global via UV tools with automatic Claude Code MCP server configuration

### Breaking Changes
- First stable release - no breaking changes from previous versions
