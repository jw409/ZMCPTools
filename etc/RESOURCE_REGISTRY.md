## Available MCP Resources

MCP Resources provide 97% token reduction compared to tools for read-only operations.

### File Analysis

| URI Template | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `file://*/ast` | Parse source file to Abstract Syntax Tree with token optimization (use file://{path}/ast?compact=true&use_symbol_table=true&max_depth=3&include_semantic_hash=false&omit_redundant_text=true) |
| `file://*/symbols` | Extract symbols (functions, classes, methods, interfaces) from source file (use file://{path}/symbols?include_positions=true) |
| `file://*/imports` | Extract all import statements from source file (use file://{path}/imports) |
| `file://*/exports` | Extract all export statements from source file (use file://{path}/exports) |
| `file://*/structure` | Get Markdown-formatted code structure outline (use file://{path}/structure) |
| `file://*/diagnostics` | Get syntax errors and parse diagnostics (use file://{path}/diagnostics) |

### Project Analysis

| URI Template | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `project://*/structure` | Get project directory tree with smart ignore patterns (use project://{path}/structure?max_depth=5&exclude=node_modules) |

### Knowledge Graph

| URI Template | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `knowledge://search` | üîç SEARCH BEFORE IMPLEMENTING: Search GitHub issues, architecture docs, implementation patterns, and prior solutions. Contains: ZMCPTools issues, TalentOS architecture (CLAUDE.md, etc/*.md, docs/*.md), design decisions, and known solutions. Use for: finding prior work, understanding architecture, discovering existing solutions, checking if feature exists. GPU-accelerated semantic + BM25 hybrid search. Example: knowledge://search?query=resource+migration+MCP&limit=5 |
| `knowledge://entity/*/related` | üìä DISCOVER CONNECTIONS: Find entities related to a specific entity via graph traversal. Use after finding an entity via search to discover: related issues, connected docs, dependency chains, implementation patterns, similar solutions. Example: knowledge://entity/issue-35/related?limit=5&min_strength=0.6 finds docs/issues related to issue #35 |
| `knowledge://status` | üìà KNOWLEDGE GRAPH HEALTH: Get statistics about indexed content - total entities, relationships, quality metrics, entity types, index freshness. Use to: verify indexing completed, check what |

### Agent Management

| URI Template | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `agents://list` | üë• LIST ALL AGENTS: View spawned agents with filtering by status (active/completed/failed/terminated) and type (backend/frontend/testing/documentation). Use for: checking what agents are running, finding agents by task type, monitoring agent health, debugging agent issues. Supports pagination for large agent pools. Example: agents://list?status=active&type=backend&limit=20 |
| `agents://*/status` | üéØ MONITOR SPECIFIC AGENT: Get detailed status of a single agent including task progress, current activity, health metrics, error history, resource usage, and completion status. Use for: debugging agent issues, monitoring long-running tasks, checking why agent stalled, getting detailed progress. Example: agents://agent-123/status |
| `agents://insights` | Aggregated insights and learnings from agents (use ?limit=100&cursor=token&memoryType=insight&agentId=id&search=text) |

### Vector Search

| URI Template | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `vector://collections` | üìö BROWSE VECTOR COLLECTIONS: List all LanceDB collections with statistics (doc count, embedding dimensions, storage size). Use `?search=text` to find specific collections. Useful for discovering available knowledge bases before semantic search. |
| `vector://search` | üîç SEMANTIC SEARCH: Find documents by meaning, not keywords. Query across vector collections using embeddings for similarity matching. Returns top-N most relevant results with cosine similarity scores. Use `?collection=name` to target specific knowledge bases. |
| `vector://status` | üìä VECTOR DATABASE HEALTH: Check LanceDB connection status, TalentOS GPU integration info, active embedding models (Stock vs Enhanced mode), and available vector collections. Use to verify GPU acceleration and model configuration before operations. |

### Logging

| URI Template | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `logs://list` | üìÇ BROWSE LOG DIRECTORIES: List all log directories in ~/.mcptools/logs/ organized by agent, session, or service type. Use to discover available logs before drilling down to specific files. Returns directory names and file counts. |
| `logs://*/files` | üìÑ LIST LOG FILES: Get all log files in a specific directory (e.g., `logs://agent-123/files`). Returns filenames, sizes, timestamps. Use to identify relevant logs before reading content (recent errors, specific operations). |
| `logs://*/content` | üìñ READ LOG CONTENT: Get full content of specific log file (e.g., `logs://agent-123/content?file=errors.log`). Use for debugging, error analysis, or reviewing agent execution history. Supports text/plain logs with timestamps and stack traces. |
