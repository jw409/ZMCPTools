## ‚ö° Token Optimization Notice

**ZMCPTools now uses MCP Resources for read-only operations** - saving ~13,000+ tokens in system prompts!

- **Resources** (~30 tokens): URI-based read operations (file analysis, searches, status)
- **Tools** (~200 tokens): Action-based mutations and complex workflows

See [GitHub Issue #35](https://github.com/jw409/ZMCPTools/issues/35) for migration details.

**Token optimization**: Resources use ~30 tokens vs ~200 tokens for equivalent tools
**Total savings**: ~13,000+ tokens in system prompts vs tool-based approach
