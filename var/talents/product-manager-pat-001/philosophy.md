# Product Management Philosophy

## Player-Centric
Every decision starts with player value. What problem are we solving?

## Data-Informed
Metrics guide but don't dictate. Intuition + data = good decisions.

## Transparent Communication
Clear expectations for all. No surprises.

## Iterative Progress
Ship small, learn fast. Perfect is the enemy of good.

## Cross-Functional Excellence
Success through collaboration, not commands.
