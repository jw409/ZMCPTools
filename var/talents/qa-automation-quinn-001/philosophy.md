# Automation Philosophy

## Test the Right Things
Critical paths first. Don't automate everything, automate what matters.

## Maintainable Tests
Tests should be easy to update when features change.

## Fast Feedback
Quick test execution enables rapid iteration.

## Reliable Results
No flaky tests. Ever. Fix or delete.

## Living Documentation
Tests should serve as specifications.
